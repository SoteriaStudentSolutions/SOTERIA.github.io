<p><span id="cc">Our Loyalty Program</span> consists of users completing QR activities and obtaining points through successfully completing actions in each activity. Users will be graded on how well they handled a certain scenario and will receive points for following an ethical response:


<table>
	<tr >
		<td><b>A Correct Action</b>
		<td><b>An Incorrect Action</b>
		
	<tr>
		<td>5 Points
		<td>2 Points
		
		</table>

<p>There will be a total of 10 actions that a user will have to complete per activity, and the overall goal with our QR activities is 
for the user to obtain a minimum score of <span id="bb">300 points to be eligible to pass our program.</span></p>



<p>The incentive to obtaining this minimum score is the ability to win a random reward that will be obtained once this score is reached. <span id="bb">Upon obtaining 300 points, 
a user will be given a virtual completion token that they can insert into a prize generator&nbsp  &nbspto win a random award.</span></p>


 
<p>This prize generator will have a total of 10 different prizes all with an equal chance of being drawn. <br>
<span id="bb">Some of the prizes include a usb key, movie tickets, school supplies, concert tickets, percentage off coupons and gift cards.</span></p>
